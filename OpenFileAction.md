To open an existing image, you can select `File > Open` or press `Ctrl+O`. In this dialog you can browse to find the existing image you wish to edit. The top row of buttons in this dialog allow you to go back one folder, forward one folder, and up to the parent folder (`Backspace`).

You can type the `Name` and select the `File Format` of the image at the bottom of the dialog to select an image, or you can click on the file name in the middle section of the dialog.

Aseprite currently supports opening the following formats:

  * .ase `*`
  * .aseprite
  * .bmp
  * .flc
  * .fli
  * .gif
  * .ico
  * .jpg
  * .jpeg
  * .pcx
  * .png
  * .tga

`*` Aseprite supports opening Aseprite (.ase) files, not Adobe Swatch Exchange (.ase) files.
