The background color is the one used to draw with the right mouse button. You can change this color pressing `Alt+Right click` or using the Eyedropper tool (`I key`) and doing a `Right click`.

The background color is used in operation like [Cut](CutCopyPaste.md) or [Clear](Clear.md) to erase the [Background layer](BackgroundLayer.md) in the [selected region](Selection.md).
