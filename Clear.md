# Clear #

To `Clear` the canvas, you can select `Edit > Clear` or use the keyboard shortcut `Del`.

The current [background color](BackgroundColor.md) is used to clear the canvas if you are in the [Background layer](BackgroundLayer.md), or the [transparent color](TransparentColor.md) is used in case that you are in a [transparent layer](TransparentLayer.md).
