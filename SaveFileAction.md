# Save File #

To save the image you are working on, you can select `File > Save` (`Ctrl+S`), or `File > Save As` (`Ctrl+Shift+S`). The `Save As` action differs from the `Save` action in that `Save As` always shows the dialog for you to enter a name for the image, change the file format, or change where you wish to save the image. `Save` will only show the dialog once if used on a `New File`; further uses of `Save` will not show this dialog.

You can type the `Name` of the image and select the `File Format` of the image at the bottom of the dialog, or you can click on an existing image in the middle section of the dialog to overwrite that image.

Aseprite currently supports saving the following formats:

  * .ase `*`
  * .aseprite
  * .bmp
  * .flc
  * .fli
  * .gif
  * .ico
  * .jpg
  * .jpeg
  * .pcx
  * .png
  * .tga

`*` Aseprite supports saving Aseprite (.ase) files, not Adobe Swatch Exchange (.ase) files.
